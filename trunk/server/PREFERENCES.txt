This document describes the preferences that control the operation
of the femtocms server.

expire.factor = 100
	The expires header of HTTP responses is set based on the rendering
	time taken for that particular page. This should allow the server
	to scale gracefully even to expensive pages. The expires.factor is
	a floating point number that is multiplied with the rendering time
	to generate the expires header. So, if rendering for a page takes
	1.2 seconds, the expires header will be set to 2 minutes in the
	future with the default setting.

fck.archive = fck/FCKeditor_2.0.zip
	The FCK editor archive location. Resources for the editor will be
	loaded directly from the distribution ZIP.

hg.command = hg
	The path to the hg command, this is the mercurial version control
	implementation.

httpd.port = 80
	The TCP port number for the HTTP server.

https.cert
	This is the SSL (HTTPS) PKCS#12 key and certificate file. There is
	no fallback for this preference; if it is left undefined the SSL
	server will be left unconfigured.

https.pass = ""
	This is the SSL (HTTPS) key passphrase. The fallback is the empty
	string. If the passphrase fails to decrypt the key and certificate
	file, the user will be prompted for the passphrase interactively.
	Reading the passphrase from standard input works only if there is
	a controlling tty. If started without controlling tty, the passphrase
	must be configured as a preference. This is true also for operating
	systems that do not provide a tty, or that lack the stty command.

https.port = 443
	The TCP port number for the HTTPS server.

root.mount = .
	The repository path for the root mount.
