水星 - Water Star
================

This package provides generation management of resources based on the idea
of mercurial[1].

The water star is the asian name for the planet mercury[2]. It was chosen
as the name for this package because of its similarity with the mercurial
name, and the proximity to the sun to reflect the java implementation.
